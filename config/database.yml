##  File: database.yml
##  Desc: Defines the database environment
##
##        Since Heroku over-writes this file, the production
##        setting is basically ignored.  Only the development
##        and test environments have any consequence.  With CI
##        testing being done by Travis its possible that the
##        test environment is useless as well.
